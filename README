PDF-Cairo

PDF::Cairo is a simple API for creating PDF files using the Cairo
graphics library, loosely based on PDF::API2::Lite, but with more
robust font support provided by Font::FreeType and Pango if those
modules are also installed (strongly recommended). If the Fontconfig
CLI utilities fc-list and fc-match are in your path, they will be used
to search for the Adobe PDF core fonts or the closest equivalent. If
not, names like Times-Roman will be replaced with the Cairo internal
font mapping.
