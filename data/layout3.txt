<span font="Times 10">This is a test of the <i>Emergency Broadcast
System</i>. The broadcasters of your area, in voluntary cooperation with
the Federal, State, and Local authorities, have developed this system
to keep you informed in the event of an emergency. If this had been an
actual emergency, the Attention Signal you just heard would have been
followed by official information, news or instructions. This station
serves the <b>Arkham</b> area.


This concludes this test of the <i>Emergency Broadcast System</i>.</span>
